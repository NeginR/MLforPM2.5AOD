# Machine Learning for PM2.5 Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning-based framework designed to predict **PM2.5 concentrations** using satellite-derived **Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)** data. This project explores the intricate relationship between PM2.5 and AOD while leveraging advanced machine learning techniques for environmental modeling and air quality assessment.

## Project Overview

Air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter (PM2.5), poses significant risks to human health and the environment. This project aims to address this challenge by:
- Utilizing satellite data (e.g., AOD) as a proxy for PM2.5 measurements.
- Developing machine learning models to predict PM2.5 levels in various regions.
- Generating insights and visualizations to assist in pollution monitoring and mitigation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Placeholder for raw and processed datasets (datasets are not included due to size restrictions).
- `input.csv`: This dataset (Montreal) is an example for running the code.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `ML for AOD PM_Temp.ipynb`: Main notebook for end-to-end implementation.
- `scripts`: Google Earth Engine codes for AOD visualization.
